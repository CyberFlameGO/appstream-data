Summary:
  C: GTK application for managing firmware updates
Description:
  C: >-
    <p>
        The Firmware Manager is a simple GTK application for managing firmware updates. It
        sources information on available firmware updates from both fwupd and
        system76-firmware, and then displays that information seamlessly in one interface.
        Only devices which are managed by either service are displayed in the UI.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is not required to have either fwupd or system76-firmware installed to use the
        application. The application will only display devices which have been discovered
        from services accessible on the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application monitors USB hotplug events, and will refresh the firmware list when
        USB devices are inserted or removed. A refresh button is also included in the UI to
        manually reload the devices in the UI.
    </p>
